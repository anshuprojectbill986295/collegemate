# College Mate App

College Mate is an Android application designed to help college students
manage class schedules, assignment deadlines, and academic notifications
in one centralized place.

## Problem Statement

In our college, important academic updates are usually shared on WhatsApp
groups or PDF files. This causes several problems:

- Important class cancellation or schedule updates get lost among many messages
- Students do not regularly check WhatsApp groups
- There is no single place to track assignment deadlines and test syllabus
- Students need to open PDF files repeatedly just to see today's schedule
- Information is not real-time or organized

A survey conducted with 30 students confirmed these issues and showed
strong interest in a dedicated academic app.

## Goal

To build a simple, centralized, and real-time Android app that helps
students stay updated with their daily academic activities.
